### `gini` command

This command measures the Gini coefficient, a measure of equality/inequality of outcome, on the entire awards. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient) for more detail.


**Usage**

```
$ ./c4-stats gini --help
usage: c4-stats gini [-h]

Calculate the Gini coefficient for the entire competition
0 is complete equality of result, 1 is all awards going to one person
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)
```

**Examples**

```
$ ./c4-stats gini
```

```json
{
  "gini": 0.8637485784663245
}
```


### `gini-wardens` command

This command is a lot like `gini` except that instead of treating each warden as an individual, it assumes a particular warden, and then calculates the Gini coefficient treating each _competition_ as an individual. Thus, it is a measure of consistency from competition to competition. A score of 0 would mean the warden always received the same award, while a score of 1 would mean they received 0 on all competitions save one.

This command can take multiple wardens as arguments.

**Usage**

```
$ ./c4-stats gini-wardens --help
usage: c4-stats gini-wardens [-h] warden [warden ...]

Calculate the Gini coefficient for one or more wardens where each contest
is treated as an individual. The closer to 0 the more consistent a
warden is.

positional arguments:
  warden
```

**Examples**

```
$ ./c4-stats gini-wardens cmichel 0xRajeev
```

```json
[
  {
    "gini(cmichel)": 0.5353830055383504
  },
  {
    "gini(0xRajeev)": 0.3878875606298723
  }
]
```
